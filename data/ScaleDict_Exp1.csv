This mock scan appointment will last approximately two hours. The second appointment is the actual functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, where you will play computer games while we take pictures of your brain. This appointment will be 2.5 hours, and the scan will last approximately 90 minutes. You will be compensated at a rate of $25 an hour while inside the scanner, and an additional $15 an hour for time spent outside the scanner.

<em>""What I am about to tell you is important. Please don't share this information with other people: 

During these tasks, you were only interacting with a computer. NO OTHER REAL PEOPLE read or saw anything about you or talked with you. You did not actually read or see information about any other participants. 


We told you that you were going to interact with real people because people act differently if they think they are interacting with real people instead of a computer. We have designed these tasks so that they will be the most helpful to others in the future, and in order for us to do this, we needed you to believe that you were interacting with others. 

We wanted to tell you about this immediately, since we only deceive research participants when it is absolutely necessary and want to discuss why this is so whenever we do this. 


The only thing that we ask is that you do not share this information with anyone because it is very important that everyone in our study believes that there are real people involved. If some people know that they are interacting with a computer and others do not, then our study would not tell us anything. If you have any questions or worries, please let us know-we would like very much to discuss this with you and do what we can to make sure you are comfortable with this. ""
