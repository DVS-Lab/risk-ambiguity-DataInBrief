## Dataset Overview
**Dataset Name**: A Dataset of Risky and Ambiguous Decisions Using a Novel Linked Colored Lottery Task Across Two Studies 
**Principal Investigator**: David V. Smith
**Authors**: James B. Wyngaarden III*, Yi Yang*, Jeffrey B. Dennison*, David V. Smith

## Study Description
Decision-making under ambiguity has been linked to individual differences of clinical importance; however, analyses related to these concepts often rely on a max-min model which ignores the possible influence of individual beliefs about the underlying choice probabilities. Using a novel Linked Colored Lottery Task in two samples (N=46 in-person, N=287 online), we provide a dataset that enables researchers to explore how individual beliefs about underlying probabilities and preferences for their distributions influence ambiguous decision-making, beyond traditional max-min models.
